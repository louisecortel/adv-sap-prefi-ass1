## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
-A method of structuring and creating software systems that treats its various services or functions as separate, self-contained units is known as service-oriented architecture, or SOA.
 In order to accomplish more sophisticated functionalities, these services can interact with one another and carry out particular tasks.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-Standardized Service Contracts
Service contracts include metadata for discovery that also informs humans of their capabilities and purpose.

-Composability
Service delivery should be effective, meaning that each individual processing step needs to be fine-tuned.

-Interoperability
Standards for services should be such that a variety of subscribers can use them.

-Loose Coupling
Services reduce mutual reliance and establish particular kinds of relationships.

-Abstraction
Services shield the external world from the logic they encapsulate.

-Service Reusability
The goal of segmenting logic into services is to maximize reuse.

-Autonomy
The logic that services encapsulate should be under their control.

-Statelessness
Stateless services are the ideal.

-Discoverability
Typically, a service registry is where one can find services.


3. Define Microservices.
Software developers can use the microservices architectural approach, which divides a large application into smaller, independent services that cooperate to provide the application's overall functionality.
These services, referred to as "microservices," can all be developed, deployed, and scaled independently and are each focused on a particular business capability.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-Code can be updated more easily.
-Teams can use different stacks for different components.
-Conponents can be scaled independently of one another, reducing the waste and cost associated with having to scale entire applications because a single feature might be facing too much load.


5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-SOA: Encompasses a broader and more abstract approach. Services in SOA may not be as small or focused as microservices and could be more monolithic in nature.
-Microservices: Specifically emphasizes small, independent, and narrowly focused services. Microservices are typically smaller in scope compared to traditional SOA services.

-Both SOA and microservices are service-oriented architectures, meaning they organize software as a set of services or functions that can be used independently.

-In essence, both SOA and microservices are service-oriented architectural styles, but microservices represent a more specialized and modern evolution with a focus on smaller, independently deployable services. The choice between them depends on the specific needs and context of the project or organization.
